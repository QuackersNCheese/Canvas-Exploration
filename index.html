  <h1>Drawing with Canvas</h1>
  <p>I'm using an   
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial">
    MDN Web Docs</a> tutorial as a guide to build a simple website to learn how to 
    draw with the Canvas API. I've made an .html, a .css, and a .js file to create 
    and control a canvas element. I plan to make this document to explain how I'm 
    building it, as I am inspired to build it by the tutorial. (with my own flair,
    of course) It seems like github copilot wants to help too, so I'm letting it.</p>
    
  <canvas id="tutorial" height="320" width="480" alt="introductory drawing"></canvas>
    <h2>Setting Up</h2>
    <p>The HTML document doesn't need much more than a canvas element and links to 
      CSS and JavaScript. I adjust the CSS file as I write in the HTML file when I 
      want to make it look good. The JavaScript file is where all of the programmatic
      drawing occurs. At first, most of the drawing is in a draw function. Running 
      the draw function happens through the event listener at the bottom of the .js 
      file.</p>
    <p>I'm using the <code>getContext()</code> method to get a 2d rendering context 
      for the drawing surface of the canvas, and then drawing shapes with various 
      properties as examples. </p>
    <h2>Rectangles</h2>
    <p>I'm using the
      <code>fillStyle</code> property to set the color of the fill, and the
      <code>fillRect()</code> method to draw a filled rectangle on the canvas. I'm
      using the <code>strokeStyle</code> property to set the color of the stroke, and
      the <code>strokeRect()</code> method to draw a rectangle outline on the canvas.</p>
      <p>I'm using the <code>clearRect()</code> method to clear the canvas. I'm using the
      <code>beginPath()</code> method to begin a path, the <code>moveTo()</code> method
      to move the starting point of a new sub-path to the (x, y) coordinates, the
      <code>lineTo()</code> method to add a straight line to the current sub-path, the
      <code>stroke()</code> method to draw the path, and the <code>fill()</code> method
      to fill the path. I'm using the <code>arc()</code> method to create an arc, the
      <code>fillText()</code> method to draw filled text on the canvas, and the
      <code>strokeText()</code> method to draw outlined text on the canvas. I'm using
      the <code>drawImage()</code> method to draw an image on the canvas. I'm using the
      <code>createLinearGradient()</code> method to create a linear gradient, the
      <code>createRadialGradient()</code> method to create a radial gradient, and the
      <code>createPattern()</code> method to create a pattern. I'm using the
      <code>shadowColor</code> property to set the color of the shadow, the
      <code>shadowBlur</code> property to set the blur level of the shadow, the
