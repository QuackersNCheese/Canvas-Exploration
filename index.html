  <h1>Drawing with Canvas</h1>
  <p>I'm using an   
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial">
    MDN Web Docs</a> tutorial as a guide to build a simple website to learn how to 
    draw with the Canvas API. I've made an .html, a .css, and a .js file to create 
    and control a canvas element. I plan to make this document to explain how I'm 
    building it, as I am inspired to build it by the tutorial. (with my own flair,
    of course) It seems like github copilot wants to help too, so I'm letting it.</p>
    
  <canvas id="tutorial" height="320" width="480" alt="introductory drawing"></canvas>
    <h2>Setting Up</h2>
    <p>The HTML document doesn't need much more than a canvas element and JavaScript. 
      The code below is just about the simplest amount of code to get started. Then,
      it's just a matter of drawing on it.</p>
<pre>HTML
<hr>
&lt;canvas id="draw_pad"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
&lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


script.js
<hr>
const canvas = document.getElementById("draw_pad");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

// drawing code here
</pre>
    <h2>Drawing objects</h2>
